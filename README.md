# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Preview docs with
```bash
docsify server
```

## Writing content


- `index.html` as the entry file
- `README.md` as the home page
- `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore

You can easily update the documentation in `./README.md`, of course you can add [more pages](newpage.md).
